NEWS for launchpadlib
=====================

1.6.0 (2010-04-07)
==================

- Fixed a test to work against the latest version of Launchpad.

1.5.8 (2010-03-25)
==================

- Use version 1.0 of the Launchpad web service by default.

1.5.7 (2010-03-16)
==================

- Send a Referer header whenever making requests to the Launchpad
  website (as opposed to the web service) to avoid falling afoul of
  new cross-site-request-forgery countermeasures.

1.5.6 (2010-03-04)
==================

- Fixed a minor bug when using login_with() to access a version of the
  Launchpad web service other than the default.

- Added a check to catch old client code that would cause newer
  versions of launchpadlib to make nonsensical requests to
  https://api.launchpad.dev/beta/beta/, and raise a helpful exception
  telling the developer how to fix it.

1.5.5
=====

- Added the ability to access different versions of the Launchpad web
  service.

1.5.4 (2009-12-17)
==================

- Made it easy to get anonymous access to a Launchpad instance.

- Made it easy to plug in different clients that take the user's
  Launchpad login and password for purposes of authorizing a request
  token. The most secure technique is still the default: to open the
  user's web browser to the appropriate Launchpad page.

- Introduced a command-line script bin/launchpad-credentials-console,
  which takes the user's Launchpad login and password, and authorizes
  a request token on their behalf.

- Introduced a command-line script bin/launchpad-request-token, which
  creates a request token on any Launchpad installation and dumps the
  JSON description of that token to standard output.

- Shorthand service names like 'edge' should now be respected
  everywhere in launchpadlib.

1.5.3 (2009-10-22)
==================

- Moved some more code from launchpadlib into the more generic
  lazr.restfulclient.

1.5.2 (2009-10-01)
==================

- Added a number of new sample scripts from elsewhere.

- Added a reference to the production Launchpad instance.

- Made it easier to specify a Launchpad instance to run against.

1.5.1 (2009-07-16)
==================

- Added a sample script for uploading a release tarball to Launchpad.

1.5.0 (2009-07-09)
==================

- Most of launchpadlib's code has been moved to the generic
  lazr.restfulclient library. launchpadlib now contains only code
  specific to Launchpad. There should be no changes in functionality.

- Moved bootstrap.py into the top-level directory. Having it in a
  subdirectory with a top-level symlink was breaking installation on
  Windows.

- The notice to the end-user (that we're opening their web
  browser) is now better formatted.

1.0.1 (2009-05-30)
==================

- Correct tests for new launchpad cache behavior in librarian

- Remove build dependency on setuptools_bzr because it was causing bzr to be
  downloaded during installation of the package, which was unnecessary and
  annoying.

1.0 (2009-03-24)
================

- Initial release on PyPI
