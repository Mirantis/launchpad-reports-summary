        NEWS for launchpadlib
        =====================
        
        1.6.0 (2010-04-07)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed a test to work against the latest version of Launchpad.
        
        1.5.8 (2010-03-25)
        ==================
        
        - Use version 1.0 of the Launchpad web service by default.
        
        1.5.7 (2010-03-16)
        ==================
        
        - Send a Referer header whenever making requests to the Launchpad
          website (as opposed to the web service) to avoid falling afoul of
          new cross-site-request-forgery countermeasures.
        
        1.5.6 (2010-03-04)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed a minor bug when using login_with() to access a version of the
          Launchpad web service other than the default.
        
        - Added a check to catch old client code that would cause newer
          versions of launchpadlib to make nonsensical requests to
          https://api.launchpad.dev/beta/beta/, and raise a helpful exception
          telling the developer how to fix it.
        
        1.5.5
        =====
        
        - Added the ability to access different versions of the Launchpad web
          service.
        
        1.5.4 (2009-12-17)
        ==================
        
        - Made it easy to get anonymous access to a Launchpad instance.
        
        - Made it easy to plug in different clients that take the user's
          Launchpad login and password for purposes of authorizing a request
          token. The most secure technique is still the default: to open the
          user's web browser to the appropriate Launchpad page.
        
        - Introduced a command-line script bin/launchpad-credentials-console,
          which takes the user's Launchpad login and password, and authorizes
          a request token on their behalf.
        
        - Introduced a command-line script bin/launchpad-request-token, which
          creates a request token on any Launchpad installation and dumps the
          JSON description of that token to standard output.
        
        - Shorthand service names like 'edge' should now be respected
          everywhere in launchpadlib.
        
        1.5.3 (2009-10-22)
        ==================
        
        - Moved some more code from launchpadlib into the more generic
          lazr.restfulclient.
        
        1.5.2 (2009-10-01)
        ==================
        
        - Added a number of new sample scripts from elsewhere.
        
        - Added a reference to the production Launchpad instance.
        
        - Made it easier to specify a Launchpad instance to run against.
        
        1.5.1 (2009-07-16)
        ==================
        
        - Added a sample script for uploading a release tarball to Launchpad.
        
        1.5.0 (2009-07-09)
        ==================
        
        - Most of launchpadlib's code has been moved to the generic
          lazr.restfulclient library. launchpadlib now contains only code
          specific to Launchpad. There should be no changes in functionality.
        
        - Moved bootstrap.py into the top-level directory. Having it in a
          subdirectory with a top-level symlink was breaking installation on
          Windows.
        
        - The notice to the end-user (that we're opening their web
          browser) is now better formatted.
        
        1.0.1 (2009-05-30)
        ==================
        
        - Correct tests for new launchpad cache behavior in librarian
        
        - Remove build dependency on setuptools_bzr because it was causing bzr to be
          downloaded during installation of the package, which was unnecessary and
          annoying.
        
        1.0 (2009-03-24)
        ================
        
        - Initial release on PyPI
